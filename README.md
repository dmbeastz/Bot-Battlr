# Bot Battle App 
The Bot Army project is a web application that allows users to manage a collection of bots, enlist them into their army, release them, and view bot details.

## Features
1. View profiles of all bots in the BotCollection.

2. Add an individual bot to your army by clicking on it. The selected bot renders in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.

3. Release a bot from your army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.

4. Discharge a bot from their service forever by clicking the red button marked "Discharge", which deletes the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.
